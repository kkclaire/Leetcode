# Implement strStr().
# Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

# Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
# Output: 2

# What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.
# For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().
